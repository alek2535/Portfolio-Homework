[Homework Assignment for week 2](https://alek2535.github.io/Portfolio-Homework/)

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a responsive website with working links. I created three seperate files that all contected to each other with proper href location in the a tags. This can be found in the navbar that was required to be on each page. I made them consistant for each page so they look the same at each media query.

Along with the navbar being consistant and response, all images and layouts needed to be responsive as well. I achieved this by making sure that all the containers had the proper break point and sizing for those break point. All images contained the class "img-fluid" so that they would be responsive on any size screen.

This project was done with bootstrap primarily. The only style not from bootstrap was the body background image. I used inline style to get this done. I made sure to use the grid system to get the right sizing of rows and columns along with the components to style each page.

Last thing of note is the footer. I tried to make a sticky footer and was unsuccessful at doing this for two pages. The footer is responsive all small screens for all pages, but is not flush with the bottom on larger screens. This something that needs to worked on and fixed in the future.

I also used to a validation site to make sure that the html was semantic and had no errors.
